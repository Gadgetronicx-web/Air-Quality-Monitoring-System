# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System

Author: Mrudula from www.gadgetronicx.com

Urban areas all around the world severely suffer due to low air quality, unusual temperature and other factors that puts the health of dwellers at risk. This project was built to monitor and sample atmospheric parameters such as Carbon monoxide concentration, Temperature and Humidity in targeted spots in a city. The collected data was later sampled and analyzed to determine the factors that affects these key parameters. In this project we have documented the data in two spots in an urban population, five kilometers apart from each other. We have analyzed the data and deduced the factors that influenced these results.
